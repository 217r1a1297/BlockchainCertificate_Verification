# 📜 Blockchain Certificate Verification
**📌 Introduction:**
Blockchain Certificate Verification is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to issue and verify digital certificates securely using
blockchain technology. Traditional certificate systems are vulnerable to forgery and manipulation. This project leverages the immutable and 
transparent nature of blockchain to ensure that certificates are:

1. Authentic
2. Tamper-proof
3. Easily verifiable by anyone

It’s ideal for universities, certification bodies, and institutions that need a trustworthy system for issuing and
verifying academic or professional credentials.

**🧠 Technologies Used:**

1. Ethereum Blockchain
2. Solidity (Smart Contracts)
3. Web3.js / Ethers.js
4. React.js (Frontend)
5. Ganache / Hardhat / Truffle (Development Tools)
6. IPFS (optional, for storing certificate files)

**📂 Project Structure:**

📁 BlockchainCertificate_Verification/

├── contracts/            # Solidity smart contracts

├── frontend/             # React frontend with Web3 integration

├── scripts/              # Deployment & interaction scripts

├── test/                 # Smart contract unit tests

├── hardhat.config.js     # Hardhat configuration

└── README.md             # Project documentation

**🚀 Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/217r1a1297/BlockchainCertificate_Verification.git
cd BlockchainCertificate_Verification

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Run local blockchain (e.g., with Hardhat or Ganache)

npx hardhat node

4. Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

6. Start the frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

**📸 Features:**

Admin can issue certificates on the blockchain.

Students/Users can verify their certificates via transaction hash or wallet address.

Frontend displays real-time verification status.

Optional IPFS integration for decentralized file storage.

**🔐 Security & Integrity:**

By using blockchain, certificates become immutable, timestamped, and publicly verifiable. This eliminates forgery and increases trust in issued credentials.
